Exclusive Wine & Co.

An ecommerce web application where wine connoisseur can seamlessly find a range of high quality alcohol and spirits to gift their loved ones and executives. In this project, I have used the MERN stack i.e. MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js alongside CSS to style. The frontend of the website has been written in React.js while backend has been written in Node.js. MongoDB has been used as the database in order to store the items and login/signup information of the user.

The benefit of using this web application ecommerce store is that you can do shop & buy gifts at the comfort of your own house, and at the convenience of your own time. You can avoid long traffic jams on the road and long queues at a physical store. The best part is that you don't have to go through the trouble of creating an account and having to login before making a purchase, you simply add your desired item into the shopping cart, go to checkout, make your payment and wait as your product gets delivered on your doorstep.
